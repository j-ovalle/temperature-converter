# Temperature Converter

## Description

Temperature Converter is an application that converts measurements from temperature units like Celsius, Fahrenheit and Kelvin to another unit. It is a console application developed in Java.

## How to use it

As this application is developed in Java you must download JRE (Java Runtime Enviroment) in order to use it. The download link is down below.

When the application runs it asks for a .txt file, an input. The first line of the input text file are just titles: Value, Origin unit, Destination unit. For the origin and destination unit you got to use this notation:

* C for Celsius
* F for Fahrenheit
* K for Kelvin

As you can see you got to put in the first column the value of the measure. Each value of the "table" is separated by a coma, like CVS.

If the format of the input file is successfuly correct, the output file will have the same format but with another title for the output conversion:
